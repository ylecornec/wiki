msgid "Continuous Integration is basically integrating your newest addition of code, or markup language, into the larger project and running a series of tests to make sure it behaves as expected. In the case of a sphinx project, the most important test is to lint the submitted reStructuredText to make sure it has correct syntax."

msgid "For linting purposes, the ``sphinx-build`` command allows you to specify a `dummy builder`_ that does syntax checks, but doesn't write output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/continuous-integration.rst:13
msgid "You can also use ``-n`` to run the builder in \"nit-picky mode\", which warns about all missing references, combined with ``-W`` to turn all warnings into errors. And finally, ``-T`` to show full traceback on exception to help debug failed build logs."

msgid "Not only can you configure `Travis-CI`_ to run on the `master branch`_, but it also supports running integration tests on `all pull requests`_ before they are to be merged."

msgid "Travis-CI also integrates with GitHub so you can see the build status on each commit or PR and wether or not the build it triggered passed or failed."
